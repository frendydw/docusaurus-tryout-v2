Databases store information and its contents can be everything from product catalogs to repositories of customer information. For information to be easy to access, use and understand, database management systems are required. Database management systems can help sort information as well as link databases to each other and provide reports about changes and trends in the information in databases.

## Oracle

Oracle SQL Developer is a free, integrated development environment that simplifies the development and management of Oracle Database in both traditional and Cloud deployments. SQL Developer offers complete end-to-end development of your PL/SQL applications, a worksheet for running queries and scripts, a DBA console for managing the database, a reports interface, a complete data modeling solution, and a migration platform for moving your 3rd party databases to Oracle.

The newest version of Oracle, 12c, is designed for the cloud and can be hosted on a single server or multiple servers, and it enables the management of databases holding billions of records. Some of the features of the latest version of Oracle include a grid framework and the use of both physical and logical structures.

## MySQL

MySQL is one of the most popular databases for web-based applications. It's freeware, but it is frequently updated with features and security improvements. There are also a variety of paid editions designed for commercial use. With the freeware version, there is a greater focus on speed and reliability instead of including a vast array of features, which can be good or bad depending on what you're attempting to do.

This database engine allows you to select from a variety of storage engines that enable you to change the functionality of the tool and handle data from different table types. It also has an easy to use interface, and batch commands let you process enormous amounts of data. The system is also incredibly reliable and doesn't tend to hog resources.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is one of several free popular databases, and it is frequently used for web databases. It was one of the first database management systems to be developed, and it allows users to manage both structured and unstructured data. It can also be used on most major platforms, including Linux-based ones, and it's fairly simple to import information from other database types using the tool.

This database management engine can be hosted in a number of environments, including virtual, physical and cloud-based environments. The latest version, PostgreSQL 9.5, offers larger data volumes and an increase in the number of concurrent users. Security has also been improved thanks to support for both DBMS_SESSION and expanded password profiles.

## Microsoft SQL Server

This Microsoft's database management engine works on cloud-based servers as well as local servers, and it can be set up to work on both at the same time. Not long after the release of Microsoft SQL Server 2016, Microsoft made it available on Linux as well as Windows-based platforms.

Some of the standout features for the 2016 edition include temporal data support, which makes it possible to track changes made to data over time. The latest version of Microsoft SQL Server also allows for dynamic data masking, which ensures that only authorized individuals will see sensitive data.
